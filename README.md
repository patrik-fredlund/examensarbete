<h1 align="center">  My UX-Portfolio </h1>

## This is a school project created as my major thesis at the Frontend Development education at KYH in Stockholm, Sweden in the spring of 2022.
It was built by me <a href="https://github.com/patrik-fredlund">Patrik Fredlund</a> with React JS using Styled Components for styling and React-router-dom for navigation.
  
It will be used as a presentation tool when I apply for work opportunities. 
The porfolio contains work samples within UX, Frontend and Graphic Design to show my skills in those areas.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
