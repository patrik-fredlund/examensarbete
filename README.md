<h1 align="center">  My UX-Portfolio </h1>

## This is a school project created as my major thesis at the Frontend Development education at KYH in Stockholm, Sweden in the spring of 2022.
It was built by me <a href="https://github.com/patrik-fredlund">Patrik Fredlund</a> with React JS using Styled Components for styling and React-router-dom for navigation.
  
It will be used as a presentation tool when I apply for work opportunities. 
The porfolio contains work samples within UX, Frontend and Graphic Design to show my skills in those areas.
