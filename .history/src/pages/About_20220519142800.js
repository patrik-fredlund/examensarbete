                the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival. And since we where so
                young we could follow them for free and watch the commercials.

                Mediagymnasiet in Nacka Strand, Advertising & Information. After

              <h2>Freelance Designer</h2>
              <p>
                When I returned from the UK I worked as a freelance designer for
                some time. I did mostly print design. I also did project work
                for design agencies, e.g Embrink Design where I e.g worked with
                the rebranding of the packaging for the yoghurt brand Yoplait.
                At this time I also worked a lot with music as a songwriter and
                artist.

              <h2>Music</h2>
              <p>
                From a young age I'we made and played music. I picked up the
                guitar at the age of 10 thanks to Angus Young who was my big
                idol. In high school I started my first band, and since then
                music has been a big part of my life. When I turned 30 I decided
                I had to try to make it in the musc industry and started a band
                called Putte & Höket. We got a record deal and released an album
                and a couple of singles and toured as a supporting act to
                Stiftelsen and Hoffmaestro at a couple of occations. I'we
                dedicated my life for 10 years but at the age of 40 I came to
                the conclusion that it's hard to make a living of it in Sweden,
                so I decided to just keep it as a hobby. I still write music to
                myself and other artists, and in the near future some songs will
                be released which I'we created. So music will allways be a part
                of my life.

              <h2>Frontend</h2>
              <p>
                This site was created as my final project on the 2 years
                frontend Deelopment education at KYH in Stockholm, Sweden. I
                built it myself as a presentation tool for when I'll apply for
                jobs. I started to reskill myself from a graphic designer to a
                webdesigner to get back into the creative field. The last couple
                of years I'we been working within other fields, but I felt I
                wanted to get back to a more creative work, because that's where
                I have my strengths and what I love to do. I had no experience
                of code before I started this course, except a beginners course
                at Jensens School to learn basic html, javascript and css, which
                I attended acouple of months before I started at KYH.

              <h2>UX</h2>
              <p>
                At KYH frontend Development education we also had alot of UX
                courses. So in that process I fell in love with UX design.
                Especially the research part. It reminds me of graphic
                communication which is close to my heart, so I felt straight at
                home during these courses. That's when I decided I wanted to
                work with UX design after my studies. I love to dig in and
                search for that perfect solution. And in brainstorm session and
                workshops is where my creative side flourish.

              <h2>UX intern</h2>
              <p>
                As a part of the frontend development education at KYH I had a
                internship at a startup called Aline, which is an edtech
                company. Their service is an App which is a platform for more
                effective learning. My role at the company was as a UX designer.
                So now I got the chance to apply the skills that I'we learned
                and to see if it was something for me. Oh yes it was. For me, my
                internship at Aline has been incredibly rewarding. I had the
                chance to work with real projects and learned to take
                responsibility and deliver a professional result. Being
                responsible makes me confident and gives me a feeling that I can
                do this and be good at it. For me it's very important to feel
                that I contribute to the team and comapany.

              <h2>UX intern tasks</h2>
              <p>
                The project I mainly worked with was{' '}
                <b className='bolder'>
                  improving the user experience on Aline's website.
                </b>{' '}
                I did a<b className='bolder'>thorough UX analysis</b> of the
                page in the form of the{' '}
                <b className='bolder'>
                  double diamond method: discover, define, develop and deliver.
                </b>{' '}
                To understand the user and see the needs for improvemnts, I did
                several user testings in the form of interviews.Then I compiled
                the results and presented the findings and apllied them to the
                website. I also had the chance to work quite broadly with
                several other types of tasks. Among other things, I have on a
                daily basis participated in many workshops, where we
                brainstormed ideas including everything from marketing to
                improving various features in the app. I also helped with layout
                and design tasks. So it has been broad and very interesting, and
                since I want to do work with UX after education, it has been
                perfect for me.
