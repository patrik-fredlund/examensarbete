          I am a curious creative and driven problem-solver with a hunger to
          work with an inspiring team, with exciting projects from scratch. I'we
          just graduated from KYH where I studied Frontend Development, to learn
          to design on the web. Since erlier I have a BA(hons) in graphic design
          with a focus on typography, from University College for the Creative
          Arts at Farnham, England. <br /> My strengths are in problem solving
          and graphic design, and I believe the content, words and language are
          as important/interesting to work with, as the visuals. What you can
          expect from me is drive. I would love to work in a creative
          environment with an inspiring team. <br /> I’m also happy, loyal and
          humble. So you will get an educated and modest team player through
          thick and thin, 24/7.

              <h2>Advertising Festival in Cannes</h2>
              <p>
                I decided at an early age that I wanted to be an Art Director.
                Since my parents worked in the advertising field me and my
                sister followed them to Cannes, France every summer, to attend
                the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival. And since we where so
                young we could follow them for free and watch the commercials.
                This is when I at the age of 9 decided it I wanted to be a Art
                Director. Some summers I watched over 1000 advertising
                commericals. The car category was my favorite. On the roadtrip
                back to Sweden I spent my time comming up with commercials. I
                was hooked.

              <h2>Advertising High school</h2>
              <p>
                So when it was time to choose high school the choice was easy
                and I attendend the only advertising school in the area,
                Mediagymnasiet in Nacka Strand, Advertising & Information. After
                those three years I attended RMI Berghs, Stockholm Diplom –
                Preparatory course for visual communication.

              <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
              <p>
                From high school and further I did my Internships as a studio
                assistant at advertising and designs agencies in Stockholm
                (HLR&DDB, Stenström&Co, Fältman&Malmén, Lars Hall AB.) where I
                helped with preparation for customer presentations, with
                moodboards etc. At the age of 18 I attended the Advertising
                Festival in Cannes, as a Young Creative. So now I'm back where
                it all began for me.

              <h2>Graphic Design Uni in UK</h2>
              <p>
                I allways knew I wanted to study to become an good Art Direcor
                or Designer. So at the age of 24 I decided to get myself an
                degree in design. So in 2006 I went to UK to study print design
                at University College for the Creative Arts at Farnham. There I
                got myself an BA(hons) degree. Second year focused on print,
                packagiing and typography. The third year I'we choose typography
                as my major subject. So typography is a big intrest of mine and
                something that is close to my heart.

              <h2>Freelance Designer</h2>
              <p>
                When I returned from the UK I worked as a freelance designer for
                some time. I did mostly print design. I also did project work
                for design agencies, e.g Embrink Design where I e.g worked with
                the rebranding of the packaging for the yoghurt brand Yoplait.
                At this time I also worked a lot with music as a songwriter and
                artist.

              <h2>Music</h2>
              <p>
                From a young age I'we made and played music. I picked up the
                guitar at the age of 10 thanks to Angus Young who was my big
                idol. In high school I started my first band, and since then
                music has been a big part of my life. When I turned 30 I decided
                I had to try to make it in the musc industry and started a band
                called Putte & Höket. We got a record deal and released an album
                and a couple of singles and toured as a supporting act to
                Stiftelsen and Hoffmaestro at a couple of occations. I'we
                dedicated my life for 10 years but at the age of 40 I came to
                the conclusion that it's hard to make a living of it in Sweden,
                so I decided to just keep it as a hobby. I still write music to
                myself and other artists, and in the near future some songs will
                be released which I'we created. So music will allways be a part
                of my life.

              <h2>Frontend</h2>
              <p>
                This site was created as my final project on the 2 years
                frontend Deelopment education at KYH in Stockholm, Sweden. I
                built it myself as a presentation tool for when I'll apply for
                jobs. I started to reskill myself from a graphic designer to a
                webdesigner to get back into the creative field. The last couple
                of years I'we been working within other fields, but I felt I
                wanted to get back to a more creative work, because that's where
                I have my strengths and what I love to do. I had no experience
                of code before I started this course, except a beginners course
                at Jensens School to learn basic html, javascript and css, which
                I attended acouple of months before I started at KYH.

              <h2>UX</h2>
              <p>
                At KYH frontend Development education we also had alot of UX
                courses. So in that process I fell in love with UX design.
                Especially the research part. It reminds me of graphic
                communication which is close to my heart, so I felt straight at
                home during these courses. That's when I decided I wanted to
                work with UX design after my studies. I love to dig in and
                search for that perfect solution. And in brainstorm session and
                workshops is where my creative side flourish.

              <h2>UX intern</h2>
              <p>
                As a part of the frontend development education at KYH I had a
                internship at a startup called Aline, which is an edtech
                company. Their service is an App which is a platform for more
                effective learning. My role at the company was as a UX designer.
                So now I got the chance to apply the skills that I'we learned
                and to see if it was something for me. Oh yes it was. For me, my
                internship at Aline has been incredibly rewarding. I had the
                chance to work with real projects and learned to take
                responsibility and deliver a professional result. Being
                responsible makes me confident and gives me a feeling that I can
                do this and be good at it. For me it's very important to feel
                that I contribute to the team and comapany.

              <h2>UX intern tasks</h2>
              <p>
                The project I mainly worked with was improving the user
                experience on Aline's website. I did a thorough UX analysis of
                the page in the form of the double diamond method: discover,
                define, develop and deliver. To understand the user and see the
                needs for improvemnts, I did several user testings in the form
                of interviews.Then I compiled the results and presented the
                findings and apllied them to the website. I also had the chance
                to work quite broadly with several other types of tasks. Among
                other things, I have on a daily basis participated in many
                workshops, where we brainstormed ideas including everything from
                marketing to improving various features in the app. I also
                helped with layout and design tasks. So it has been broad and
                very interesting, and since I want to do UX after education, it
                has been perfect for me.
